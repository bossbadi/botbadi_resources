-ADD A QUEUE SYSTEM
    So that music doesn't just stop if you do the %stop
    But if multiple people are listening then queue system would be good

-(high priority) more settings:
    on member join message toggle on/off

-Different types of work? Typing is easy, but maybe math could be a job to do math problems with levels, (I.e.: Substitute, teacher, proffesser) with increasingly harder problems. Maybe add heists, but you have to defuse traps, prevent being caught, or so thing other than a dice roll.
