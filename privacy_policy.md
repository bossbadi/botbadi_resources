Privacy policy for botbadi, Discord bot by bossbadi. By having botbadi in your server, you agree to the following privacy policies:

### 1. What information is stored?
Discord data collected from the bot:\
-the author's name and message content when a message is deleted and/or edited\
-certain data whenever a message's sent (author, time, content, server, channel)\
-the user id of anyone who creates an account in this application\
-the server id of anyone who configures server settings in this application

That's all the Discord data this application collects.

### 2. Why is this data collected?
Whenever a message is deleted, the message contents and the author of the message are stored somewhere in a dictionary for that specific channel in the server. If there was a previous message deleted in that channel, it will be replaced with this newly deleted message. The reason is for the 'snipe' command in the bot. This is especially useful when a user ghost pings another user. The pinged user can run the 'snipe' command and the last deleted message in that channel will appear if any. The same holds for storing recently edited messages for the 'editsnipe' command. If servers are uncomfortable with message sniping, there is a toggle in the bot settings which will toggle message sniping on and off.

Now to the second part. The reason certain data is collected every time a new message is sent is so the developer can see the usage and reach the bot gets. This can help the developer have a better understanding of which commands are malfunctioning and which can be improved. For example, the developer can see what commands users are running for this application and their reactions to the commands. While a user is listening to music being played by the bot, they might complain that the music's a little choppy or something. When I see lots of users complaining about these issues, I will know that something needs to be fixed and I will get to it right away. I can quickly detect bugs and fix them right away rather than frustrating my users.

When a user creates an account for this application, their Discord ID is stored in a database. The ID is a reliable way of identification for the user. A user creates an account to access most of the economy commands in this application. Stuff like the user's money and the items in their inventory are stored in the database. Their bot settings are also stored.

The same holds for servers, with the ID stored. This application has a few auto-moderation features which need to be toggled in the server settings.

### 3. How long is this data stored?
For data like the edited and deleted messages, they're gone once the bot restarts once every 24 hours since it's stored in the memory. The same goes for the messages sent by users. That's all the temporary stuff stored. The permanent stuff is the database. The only Discord data stored in the database are IDs of users who've created accounts in the bot and server IDs who configured some settings such as auto-moderation for the bot. This is the data that is permanently stored.

### 4. Who can see my data?
Your data include your messages, username, and user ID. The developer does not sell or release your data to the public in any way, however, if the developer decides to share certain data from command usage, it will remain anonymous, unless stated otherwise.

If you choose to use the economy system in the bot, understand that it will store some economy stuff (i.e., balance and inventory) and settings in the bot. Only people in your server can see your name and balance in the currency system on the server leaderboard.

### 5. Can I remove my data?
If a user or a server admin would like their data removed from the database, they will first contact the developer with their concerns. This can be done through email or Discord itself. Then, the developer will do a search in the database for said user. If any rows contain the user's ID or the server's ID, whichever they want to be removed, the developer will simply delete that row in the database. That's it.

If you are concerned about the data stored, join the support server or contact the developer.

**Note:** The developer reserves the right to change this policy at any time with or without notice.
