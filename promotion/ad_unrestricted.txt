So basically what this server is is that you can do practically **WHATEVER** you want except for certain admin permissions.
This means that *anyone* can:
```css
-manage messages
-manage roles
-manage channels
-view audit log
-manage nicknames
-manage emojis
-send tts messages
-mass mention
-plus a bit more
```
**Restrictions (read carefully):**
```fix
-Cannot moderate other members (because someone will probably ban all the members)
-Primarily a safe for work server (because people of all ages are here)
```
You can think of this server as "*A town with no laws.*" If you're interested in joining, make sure that you mute and suppress all mentions so you won't go out of your mind. This is meant to be a fun community, so try your best to keep it that way
